The Pepperwood Breeding Bird Survey was initiated in the spring of 2007 with the goal of establishing a set of baseline bird community data that could be built upon for years to come. Four transects are surveyed annually (Martin Creek, Pepperwood Road, Rogers Canyon, and Weimar Flat) using standardized point count protocols outlined by the Point Reyes Bird Observatory (now called Point Blue Conservation Science; Ballard et al. 2003) and the Handbook of Field Methods for Monitoring Landbirds (Ralph et al. 1993). Counts are conducted by experienced citizen scientists and start in late April and end in June, with each transect being surveyed a total of three times during the breeding season. In 2012, the fourth transect along Pepperwood Road was added to ensure that the preserve has comprehensive monitoring coverage and includes serpentine chaparral habitat found towards the preserve entrance. This data set includes data collected between 2007 - 2017 only.
