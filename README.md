# EML
EML is for Ecological Metadata Language. It's an .xml format that describes datasets with with rich, structured metadata. This repo is a staging area for dataset descriptions that will be used to develop a comrehensive, version controlled data catalog for web display. These datasets do not belong to me, and so I have  included just table headers until dataset owners are ready to place their data into a public repository.
