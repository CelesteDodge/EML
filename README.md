# EML
EML is for Ecological Metadata Language. It's an .xml format that describes datasets with with rich, structured metadata. This repo is a staging area for dataset descriptions that will be used to develop a comrehensive, version controlled data catalog for web display. The datasets themselves are do not belong to me and so I am not sharing until data set owners are ready to place data into a public repository.
