This survey is intended to document the occurrence of fire followers, or fire-germinated species often called fire-stimulated annual plants ¬¬at Pepperwood in spring 2018. We conducted the surveys over a 3 month period from March through May to capture diverse blooming times of targeted species. We searched for all known regional fire-following annual plants, with an emphasis on species not previously recorded at Pepperwood. Surveys involved walking a route which we documented with continuous location tracking via mobile application GAIA GPS on cellular phones. We selected and walked routes in a targeted fashion, based on knowledge experienced field botanists who conducted visual searches with 70% of the effort targeted within chaparral and the remaining 30% in a combination of grassland, oak woodland, mixed evergreen and redwood forests. We documented the presence and location of all fire-germinated annual plants we encountered, and we quantified the abundance at these occurrences at random locations along  a transect. At random transect locations we counted the number of individuals per square meter at ten replicate one meter plots, located randomly along a line, the direction of which was selected to target the most vegetated areas and to avoid dangerously steep terrain. When the patch of vegetation where a fire-germinated annual was found was too small to establish 10 replicate plots in a line, the locations were selected on a fully randomized basis within the same vegetation type. Voucher specimens and photographs were taken for each species fire follower encountered and deposited into the Pepperwood herbarium. Duplicate vouchers were deposited at the California Academy of Sciences. Findings were also uploaded to the California Flora database.  We also opportunistically documented the locality of some perennials such as Xerophyllum tenax an Lilium rubescens, which are described as “fire increasers”.
