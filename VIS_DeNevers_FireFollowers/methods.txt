This survey is intended to document the occurrence of fire followers, or fire germinated species at Pepperwood in spring 2018. We conducted the surveys over a 3 month period from March through May to capture diverse blooming times of targeted species. We searched for all known regional fire-following annual plants, with an emphasis on species not previously recorded at Pepperwood. Surveys involved walking a route which we documented with continuous location tracking via mobile application GAIA GPS on cellular phones. We selected and walked routes in a targeted fashion, based on knowledge experienced field botanists who conducted visual searches with 70% of the effort targeted within chaparral and the remaining 30% in a combination of grassland, oak woodland, mixed evergreen and redwood forests. We documented the presence and location of all fire-germinated annual plants encountered, and when encountered we quantified abundance along a 50 meter transect. At transects we counted the number of individuals per square meter at ten replicate (one meter plots? located randomly?) along a 50 meter transect. When there was not enough space to establish a 50 meter transect due to XX, we did XX. Voucher specimens and photographs were taken for each species fire follower encountered and deposited into the Pepperwood herbarium. Duplicate vouchers were deposited at the California Academy of Sciences. Findings were also uploaded to the California Flora database. 
Additionally, we collected the locality and abundance of perennials such as Xerophyllum tenax and Lilium rubescens described as “fire increasers”. Fire increasers were surveyed the in same or XX methods and were quantified in XX manner or same manner as fire following annuals?
