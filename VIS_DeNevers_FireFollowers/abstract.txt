During October 2017 most of the Pepperwood Preserve burned in the Tubbs fire.  The preserve team is now monitoring the effects of the fire and the post-fire recovery process.  
One of the important botanical consequences of fire in California is that fire may stimulate the germination of seeds of annual plants that have lain dormant in the soil for 
as many as 80 years (Sweeny 1956).  This group of plants, commonly referred to as “fire followers,” are usually not seen except following a fire.  Fire followers are typically 
most abundant the first year following a fire, diminish in abundance over the next two to five years, and then are not seen again until the next fire.  At Pepperwood, fire 
following species one would expect to encounter include Emmenanthe penduliflora, Phacelia brachyloba, Phacelia heterophylla,  Phacelia  suaveolens, Mimulus rattanii, 
Antirrhinum hookereanum and Gilia capitata.  Surveying for these species and other fire-following annuals (some of which have previously been documented at Pepperwood, and 
others that have not been recorded there to date) is be an important component of the monitoring studies the preserve initiates to document the effects of the Tubbs fire.
